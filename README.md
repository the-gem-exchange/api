# The Gem Exchange API Server

To run, you will need:

- A MongoDB server connection
- NodeJS

# Running the API locally

- Start MongoDB with command `mongod`
- Start the API with command `node server.js`
- To automatically restart the server as changes are made, start the server with `nodemon` instead:
- Install: `npm install -g nodemon`
- Run: `nodemon server.js`
